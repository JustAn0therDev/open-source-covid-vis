# Open Source Covid Data Visualization

People I know (including close family members) have been affected in some way by the COVID-19, losing jobs, health (physical and mental) and even their lives. Being able to provide information about it is critical to raise awareness about the kind of negative impact the disease might have in somebody's life; open-source is able to do that in a lot of ways, from providing technical tools to data about everything that is happening.
